# A basic TypeRacer
**OUTDATED. MORE OPTIMIZED VERSION https://github.com/Tixxyy/TypeRacerV2/tree/master/src**

A TypeRacer with custom text support.

#How to use
1. Provide a .txt file that contains text (utf-8 characters).
2. Start the game.

Normal settings - Provides the sentences one by one.

Random - If checked, will pick a random sentence out of the given .txt file.

Random + CharBased - Picks a random sentence + scrambles up the characters (ignores all spaces + to insure text wrapping spaces are inserted once in a while)


## Limitations/concerns
1. Java jdk-11.
2. Supports only .txt files and utf-8 character set.
3. **The provided sentences are reasonably long + contains spaces once in a while (otherwise text wrapping wont work)**
4. The calculations for WPM may easily be wrong.
